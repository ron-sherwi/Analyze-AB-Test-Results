# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
## Food Products Startup

* <b> Hey! I'm Ron Sherwi. </b> In this project I investigated user behavior for food company's app. 


* <b>The investigation was done by A/A/B test. </b> Group B has another design for the website. 


* <b> The data was collected between 25/07/2019 - 07/08/2019. </b> More than 7500 users took a part.


* <b> The data includes </b> event type, user id, date & time of the event, and user's group.


*  <b> My goal </b> is to check for significant difference between the control groups and group B.


* <b> My project is divided to 4 parts: </b>
    1. Prepare the data for analysis.
    2. Study and check the data.
    3. Study the event funnel.
    4. Study the results of the experiment.
